## Learning Points 
This project was difficult for me in a few ways. I felt like this application really brought a lot of different concepts together in a way that I hadn't experienced before.  This was also my first use of SQL. Now after reaching the MVP I would like to optimize and clean up my code by using async await as well as using classes to create methods for the database quiries.

* mysql2
* console.table
* Continued learning with inquirer
